                               Mr. Ahadzie and his team  was instrumental in helping me to design and source a sophisticated technological device to monitor our buildings. 
                                It was a component that I had conceptualized for many years; however, I was not confident in my ability to make it a reality.
                                By outsourcing the complex engineering tasks associated with this one component, I was able to keep my focus on the big picture. 
                                We are now looking forward to a broad spectrum product launch. This software protects all our buildings from Fire and all emergency Alerts .
